You know you're near the most iconic music studios in the world when you notice a bunch of people striking funny poses on a zebra crossing. Inside, of course, the solemnity of the security guards gently reminds you where you really are. After signing the registration documents, participants of the first Abbey Road's Hackathon finally arrive at Studio 1, which is said to have witnessed from the recording of The Lord of The Rings soundtrack to Pink Floyd's members playing some improvised football game.

Twenty-four hours of coding awaited in that church-like space and there we were meeting again. MIP-Frontiers fellows [Kilian](/people#kilian), [Giorgia](/people#giorgia), [Ondřej](/people#ondrej) (Télécom) and [Alejandro](/people#alejandro) (Roli) found Tim Kirby (QMUL) and Diego Di Carlo (Univ Rennes) to serve a very cool idea: Rapple, an AI-powered opponent to challenge for a rap battle.

The hacking began, and everybody in the place went ahead to get our hands dirty, discussing the projects between us and even with participants outside our team. Here in Team Rapple, there was a very natural synergy by the time we finished the planning sketch. We were all determined to create the rudest, wittiest and most destructive rap battle opponent ever; or, at least, an amusing prototype. For that, we got some appropriate chatbot code, speech-to-text and text-to-speech software and a beat alignment algorithm for the final touch, to make Rapple deliver with flow.

Time passed comfortably for us. We held brief group discussions every hour and had some break time to drink coffee and play some music with other hackers. In the end, a working prototype of Rapple was ready by 3 am and, from then on, everything got experimental. *What if we get a vocoder for Rapple?*, proposed Tim. *Let's find a sweet spot to get the rudest punchlines!*, jumped the whole team. And in that spirit we spent the rest of the night, seasoning our little thing while getting random sleepy programmers to play and have a laugh with it.

The closing ceremony consisted in a very engaging round of project presentations (Kilian absolutely killed it rapping some nonsense in ours) and an hour of break so to let the jury deliberate. Then, the winners were announced... and Rapple came first! We got the main prize, handed by Microsoft, for the best use of AI. And so, after a pair of interviews and some farewell pints by St. Pancras station, we all went back to work on our Ph.D. projects, leaving our small but muddy footprint at Abbey Road Studios.

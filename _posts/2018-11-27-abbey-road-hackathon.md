On the 10th of November this year, Abbey Road Studios held the first edition of its hackathon in Studio 1, birthplace of iconic film soundtracks like the ones for 'The Lord of The Rings' and 'Star Wars'. All in all, about one hundred participants with 24 hours of coding ahead and a common goal: to create the next revolutionary tool for music production.

In that spirit, MIP-Frontiers fellows [Kilian](/people#kilian), [Giorgia](/people#giorgia), [Ondřej](/people#ondrej) (Télécom) and [Alejandro](/people#alejandro) (Roli) joined Tim Kirby (QMUL) and Diego Di Carlo (Univ Rennes) to work on Rapple, an AI-powered opponent to challenge for a rap battle.

The atmosphere in the team was always very dynamic and time passed rather comfortably for us. We were set to create the rudest, wittiest, most destructive rap battle opponent ever encountered; or, at least, to produce an funny prototype. For that, we got a chatbot code, speech-to-text and text-to-speech software, and a beat alignment algorithm to make Rapple deliver punchlines with 'flow'.

We were holding brief discussions every hour to put things together and, of course, getting breaks to have a coffee and play music with other participants. In the end, we came up with a working prototype by 3 am. And things got experimental from then on. *What if we get a vocoder for Rapple?*, Tim proposed, who actually went back home to get his. *Is there a sweet spot to get the rudest punchlines?*... All in all, we spent the rest of the night seasoning Rapple and getting people around to have a laugh with it.

After an engaging round of presentations for all projects (Kilian nailed it battling with Rapple in ours), the winners were announced next afternoon and Team Rapple came first! We got the main prize, handed by Microsoft, for the best use of AI. And so, after a pair of interviews and some celebration pints, we all went back to work on our Ph.D. projects. So long, Abbey Road Studios!
